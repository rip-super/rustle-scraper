Rustle Search API

This is just a (not so) small side project that i started so i could learn more about how search engines work and how to make web crawlers and stuff. this program outputs 3 files in total, a `links.txt` of all the links that the program collected, and 2 csv files (`websites.csv` and `inverted_index.csv`) that the rustle search frontend uses which is available [here](https://github.com/rip-super/rustle-client/)
